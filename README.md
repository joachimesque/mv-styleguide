# mv-styleguide

This is a little experiment, done with Mavo (https://mavo.io).

See it live : https://joachimesque.github.io/mv-styleguide/styleguide.html

Basically, I wanted a way to make a simple Styleguide very fast, so I can share it with my colleages as I design it. The page is a little under-designed, but it's a proof of concept. Ironic, I knowâ€¦

Many thanks to @LeaVerou, who's made Mavo and who gave me the idea to use `srcdoc` and an `iframe` to display the rendered element.
